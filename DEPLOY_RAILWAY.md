2. **Test the API**: 
   - `GET https://your-app.railway.app/` - API info
   - `POST https://your-app.railway.app/shorten` - Create short URLs
   - `GET https://your-app.railway.app/dashboard` - View dashboard

3. **Optional - Custom Domain**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Domains in Railway dashboard
   - Add your custom domain
   - Update DNS records as instructed

## Database Persistence

- **In-Memory** (default): Data resets on each deployment
- **File-Based**: Set `DB_PATH=./data/links.db` environment variable
- **PostgreSQL**: For production, consider Railway's PostgreSQL addon

## Monitoring

- View logs in Railway dashboard
- Monitor usage and performance
- Set up alerts for downtime
